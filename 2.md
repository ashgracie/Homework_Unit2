What do the HTTP Status Codes represent? What are the Primary HTTP Verbs and what do they mean?

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:

Informational responses (100–199)
Successful responses (200–299)
Redirection messages (300–399)
Client error responses (400–499)
Server error responses (500–599)

The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The create is used to create new resources. Read is used to retrieve a representation of a resource. Update is used to update or create a resource. And delete is used to delete a resource.
