Written HW What is Big O Notation? Contrast Big O with Omega and Theta. Show 1 Code Example Each Of Linear Time Complexity and Quadratic Time Complexity.

Big O Notation is the language that is used for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run or how much memory is used by an algorithm. Big O notation can express the worst, and the best running time of an algorithm. The difference between Big O notation and Big Ω notation is that Big O is used to describe the worst case running time for an algorithm. But, Big Ω notation, on the other hand, is used to describe the best case running time for a given algorithm. Big-O is an upper bound. Big-Theta is a tight bound, i.e. upper and lower bound. Linear time complexity means that you go through one element at a time. Making all pairs from an array would be quadratic time complexity. 

//linear
let a = new Array()
for(i = 0; i < 100; i++){
    a.push(i)
}

//quadratic
let a = new Array()
for(i = 0; i < 100; i++){
    for(j = 0; j <100; j++){
        a.push([i,j])
    }
}
